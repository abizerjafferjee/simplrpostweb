                    <span style="color: black" class="h5">Simplr Post</span> is a digital addressing system that registers unique addresses for homes and businesses so that people can get access to reliable services and get to places effortlessly.

                <h5 style="color: #000">Securely share your private home address</h5>
                <p style="color: #1bac71">
                    Simplr Post allows you to privately share your home address with users and businesses within the app. This gives you the advantage of controlling who has access to your address and ensuring that your private information is not being misused or placed in the wrong hands.
                    Having a private address can be useful for:
                    <ul style="list-style: none;color: #1bac71">
                        <li>- Efficient delivery of food to your home</li>
                        <li>- Sharing your address with emergency services</li>
                        <li>- Getting a taxi pickup</li>
                        <li>- Sharing home directions with a friend</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h5 style="color: #000">Helping customers find your business with a public business address</h5>
                <p style="color: #1bac71">
                    Registering your business on Simplr Post is a good way to get people to know its whereabouts. Most businesses struggle to get customers outside their immediate locality because they don’t have an online presence and because it’s so difficult to explain to people unfamiliar with the area where you’re located.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #1bac71">
                    A Simplr Post public address is open for anyone to discover. You can use it to talk about the services you provide, attach pictures and catalogs and most importantly let people find your business location.
                </p>
                <h5 style="color: #000">Managing customer addresses and business logistics</h5>
                <p style="color: #1bac71">
                    If you’re providing delivery services, you don’t want to repeatedly ask your customers where they are located and how to get there. Simplr Post allows users to share their home or business addresses with you directly on your public business address. These addresses get saved once into your address list and get updated directly when your customers change their permanent locations. This way you can easily search your address list and share the address with your driver next time a repeat customer makes an order.
                </p>
                <h5 style="color: #000">What’s our story?</h5>
                <p style="color: #1bac71">
                    Most of us either don’t have an address or live in a place without complete addressing systems so
                    that no one ends up using them. Solutions like Google Maps have made our lives much easier for
                    getting directions and geotagging our locations, but we still need a unique address and complete
                    addressing system that everyone can rely on to get access to better services.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #1bac71">
                    People need addresses that they can write to verify their identities on government forms. A
                    meaningful address that people can adopt, remember, identify and use to get directions. Something
                    that can be shared to get deliveries to a home or call emergency services.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #1bac71">
                    Businesses need an address to let customers know where they’re located, to offer delivery services
                    and to tell drivers where to go without having to explain directions relative to recognizable
                    landmarks.
